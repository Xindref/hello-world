This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Dakotah, I am an aspiring developer for Full-Stack applications. I am frightened of the exponential growth in AI taking over my passion pursuit, but hold out hope that there will still be a place for me in this career field. I stay on top of AI advancements every week listening to podcasts as well as information coming out of the main powerhouse organizations which probably doesn't serve to lessen any anxiety garnered from the situation. I choose to view the situation as more of a motivator, in that for now all I need to do is just be better than the current model.
